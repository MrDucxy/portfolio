                <h2 id="abMeTxt">About Me</h2>
                <p class="abMePara">Hey! My name is Ducxy, and I'm a full stack developer. What is a full stack developer? Well, a FSD is someone who works on both the frontend and the backend of any given piece of software.</p>
                <p class="abMePara">I started actually programming in Early 2020, although I had attempted to use C# a few times in 2017. 2020 is where I really took off as a programmer.
                    I first started programming frontends for ROBLOX cheats. You may have heard of them before, my most popular exploit being "Dove". This was a good place for me to start as
                    it doesn't require any advanced programming to do and it helps you learn current UI design trends along the way.
                </p>
                <p class="abMePara">
                    After working with C# and ROBLOX cheat frontends, I wanted to learn another language.
                    I wanted to learn something that felt familiar and wasn't too difficult to learn. What language did I choose? Well, you may be thinking "Python"... but no, I choose to learn JavaScript.
                    JavaScript has similar enough syntax to C# that it's pretty easy to pick up on after a few days of learning. I choose to create a Discord bot using Node.JS and the Discord.JS library. This really helped me
                    learn more about JavaScript and the inner-workings of Discord.
                </p>
                <p class="abMePara">
                    Ever since I learned C# and JavaScript, other languages such as C and Java were also pretty easy to understand and pick up as well. Knowing multiple languages is helping me out in the long run and allows me to understand a lot more.
                    I have now made some pretty interesting things in my past 2 years programming. Some of these include a web-socket based chat system with features such as image embeds, emojis, etc., 
                    A Chip 8 interpreter inside of Node.JS, Tons of ROBLOX exploit frontends for customers, Advanced Discord bots featuring databases for storing user information for economy and guild information, and much much more.
